# Your name as a number

## Description
This project calculates the sum of letter values in a name, where each letter is assigned a number based on its position in the alphabet (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26).

### Instructions
Write a program that:
1) Accepts any name, may be hardcoded (making program accept user input is optional).
2) Prints out the sum
3) Any non English-letter character (i.e. space, apostrophe) should be ignored
4) Lowercase and uppercase letters are equal
5) (Optional) Has some unit-tests included

### Example outputs
A => 1 <br/>
Z => 26 <br/>
Az => 27 <br/>
Test => 64 <br/>
Te st => 64 <br/>
Ivan => 46 <br/>

## Usage
### Install Python
1) Download Python from https://www.python.org/.
2) Run the installer.  </br>
Make sure to check the box to have Python added to your PATH if the installer offers such an option. 

### Run Main Program
1) Download the project files from the repository.
2) Open the project folder in Python.
3) Run the script and follow the instructions in the terminal to input your name. </br>
The script will print the sum of the letters in your name.

### Run Unit Tests
1) Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder (if not already there).
2) To run the tests, type:
_python -m unittest test_name_sum.py_
3) The terminal will display the test results. If all tests pass, youâ€™ll see a message saying "OK".

## Task Feedback
I think this challenge is a good way to get an understanding of how a person is approaching IT problems.
Including different levels of difficulty helps to gauge the experience and adaptability in coding. </br>
I found the task to be a good challenge for my current skill level. It allowed me to apply knowledge I already had while also learning new concepts like unit testing. I also appreciated that the task was in English, because it's a very dominant language in IT.</br>
I noticed that the description for the task is not entirely specific at one point: There are different ways to interpret how non-English letter characters should be 'ignored' which leads to varying results. It was interesting to think about the most reasonable solution. <br/>
Overall, the task was a valuable learning experience, and I enjoyed the opportunity to work on it.
